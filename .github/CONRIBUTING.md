Kripto contribution guidelines
===============================

## Issue reporting/feature requests

* **Already reported**? make sure your issue/feature hasn't been reported/requested.
* **Already fixed**? Check whether your issue/feature is already fixed/implemented.
* **Can you fix it**? If you are an Android developer, you are always welcome to fix an issue or implement a feature yourself. PRs welcome! See [Code contribution](#code-contribution) for more info.
* **Is it in English**? Issues in other languages will be ignored unless someone translates them.
* **Is it one issue**? Multiple issues require multiple reports, that can be linked to track their statuses.

## Code contribution

* If you want to help out with an existing bug report or feature request, leave a comment on that issue saying you want to try your hand at it.
* If there is no existing issue for what you want to work on, open a new one describing your changes. This gives the community a chance to give feedback before you spend time on something that is already in development, should be done differently, or should be avoided completely.
* Use proper code formatting (Ctrl+Shift+L for Android Studio) 
* Do not bring non-free software (e.g. binary blobs) into the project.
* Make changes on a separate branch with a meaningful name, not on the _master_ branch or the _dev_ branch. This is commonly known as *feature branch workflow*. You may then send your changes as a pull request (PR) on GitHub.
* Please test (compile and run) your code before submitting changes! Ideally, provide test feedback in the PR description. Untested code will **not** be merged!
* Make sure your PR is up-to-date with the rest of the code. Often, a simple click on "Update branch" will do the job, but if not, you must rebase the dev branch manually and resolve the problems on your own. You can find help [on the wiki](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/wiki/How-to-merge-a-PR) (Thanks to NewPipe). That makes the maintainers' jobs way easier.
* Please show intention to maintain your features and code after you contribute a PR. Unmaintained code is a hassle for core developers. If you do not intend to maintain features you plan to contribute, please rethink your submission, or clearly state that in the PR description.
* Respond if someone requests changes or otherwise raises issues about your PRs.
* Send PRs that only cover one specific issue/solution/bug. Do not send PRs that are huge and consist of multiple independent solutions.
* Try to figure out yourself why builds on our CI fail.

## Communication
* Post suggestions, changes, ideas etc. on GitHub or IRC.
